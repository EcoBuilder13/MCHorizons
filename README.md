This modpack may contain custom mod jar files that are not offical release builds. They should not be used outside the modpack as they may cause issues. This is done to include bug fixes and certain features to a mod but may result in instability out of the preconfigred envrioment. To identify these mods look for "mchorizons" being in the mod's file name.
